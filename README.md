Topic: Calorie Burning

I chose this topic because I am an athlete who is already interested in the idea of metabolism and burning calories as you exercise. As soon as we were told to pick a topic, athletics came to my head because this is one of my favorite topics in my life. Firstly, I searched up 'calorie burning' and scrolled down until I saw the site 'healthline.com'.This website helped inform me with formulas that are used to calculate calorie intake throughout a day.
